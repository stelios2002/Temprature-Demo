This is my 1st project using API's. AthensTemps is the POST/GET/DELETE side and KairosScraper is the WebScraper that takes temperatures from okairos.gr and puts them in a json to download them in the database.
Database using: MySQL, db name: weather_db, Table name: new_table, table attributes: int id, timestamp datetime, temperature double.
